### Compiling your plugin
Our custom [Windy Plugin Compiler](docs/PLUGIN_COMPILER.md) does all the job for you. Just run `npm start` to launch it or `npm run start-dev` to skip beginner's prompt.

### Publishing your plugin
 1) Make sure, that your `package.json` is updated, and that:
    + name, is unique name of your plugin
    + description, describes what your plugin does
    + author and repository reflects your name and where the plugin hosted is
 2) Remove this `README.md` and put there few words about your plugin (and maybe some screenshot if you want). The text from README file will be used in our planned plugins gallery.
 3) Publish your plugin as npm package by `npm publish`.  (If you are not familiar with npm, create and account and login:  https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account.)
 4) Test your published npm package on [Windy's Plugin page](https://www.windy.com/plugins)
 5) Let [us know in our community](https://community.windy.com/category/21/windy-plugins) about your new achievement.
 6) Once you are satisfied with your plugin, you can request permission for it to be approved. Your plugin will then be listed in the "windy.com/plugins" gallery,  and you will be able to use the url query string.
 7) Commit your work and pull your repository back to GitHub. Rename your repository to reflect name of your plugin.

### Conditions
It is strictly prohibited to use plugin to:
 - Modify user's setting without his consent
 - Download any of user's settings, favorites or location to your server
 - Download any meteorological data from Windy to your own server or use them in any other scope than inside your plugin
