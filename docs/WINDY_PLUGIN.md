### How Windy Plugin works
Windy plugin is piece of `js`, `css` and `html` that is compiled together into single `plugin.js` file.

The file is then published as `npm` package, and upon user's selection, loaded into Windy.com to be launched upon user's action.

### Name of your plugin
Most important configuration variable is name of your plugin, which is `name` of your `package.json` (since the name of your plugin must be the same as the name of your npm package).

The name of your plugin, and your npm package must have form `windy-plugin-anyName`

### Source files
Your `src/` directory should look like this:
```sh
config.js
plugin.js
plugin.html		// <-- optional
plugin.less 	// <-- optional
# and other folders and files if needed
```

#### plugin.js
The JS logic of your plugin, entry file.

```js
export const onmount = (node, refs) => {
	console.log(`I am mounted and attached to HTML node ${node}. If you used "data-ref" attributes in HTML, here they are: ${refs}`);
}

export const onopen = () => {
	console.log('I am open');
}

export const ondestroy = () => {
	console.log('I am being closed');
}
```

#### plugin.html
Simply contains html.

```html
<!-- This is HTML code injected into Windy.com page -->
<b>Hello world</b>
```

#### plugin.less
Your plugin will be wrapped inside `#windy-plugin-anyName` DIV. Whenever `.onwindy-plugin-anyName` class is applied to `<body>` of the page, you have chance to modify other styles on page.

```css
.onwindy-plugin-anyName .right-border {
	right: 400px;
}

#windy-plugin-anyName {
	width: 400px;
}
```

#### config.js
Basic configuration of your plugin has node.js module syntax. Remember, that `name` of your plugin, `description` and `author` is defined in your `package.json`.

```js
module.exports = {
	// Display name of your plugin, as it will appear in the menu
	displayName: 'Hello world',

	// Place, where opening link to your plugin will appear. So far only
	// Allowed: 'contextmenu', 'menu'
	hook: 'menu',

	// List of external libraries, that should be loaded before
	// your plugin is even mounted to the page
	dependencies: ['https://unpkg.com/d3@5.7.0/dist/d3.min.js']

	// List of class names that will be attached to your plugin upon mounting
	className: 'plugin-lhpane plugin-mobile-fullscreen',

	// If you want to apply different set of classes on mobile devices
	classNameMobile: 'this-is-other',

	// Forces all other window panes, with same pane id to be closed
	// Allowed: 'lhpane', 'rhpane' and 'all'
	pane: 'lhpane',

	// The place in page, where your plugin element will be mounted
	// to the page. By default all the plugins are attached to
	// #plugins div
	attachPoint: '#map_container .leaflet-popup-pane',

	// If you want to apply different mounting point on mobile devices
	attachPointMobile: '#plugins'
}
```

## The life cycle of the plugin
### Loading of the plugin
Whenever Windy loads your plugin, following actions will happen:
1) Your `plugin.js` is loaded into Windy, and function `W.loadPlugin` is executed.
2) Link for opening of your plugin is attached to particular menu (defined as `hook` in `config.js`)
3) Done, your plugin is now ready to use. Now user must open your plugin by clicking on a hook link.

### Mounting
Whenever your plugin is opened for the first time, it must be "mounted" to the page:
 1) `html` code of your plugin is wrapped inside `div` with id `windy-plugin-anyName`. Inside is inserted another `div` element, that will act as closing button. Whole plugin element has style `display:none`.
 2) `css` code of your plugin is attached to `<head>` section of Windy
 3) Your plugin element is then inserted into the page inside element, where you required in `config.js` as `attachPoint` (by default inside `#plugins` DIV)
 4) Js code inside `plugin.js` is launched
 5) If method `onmount` is exported in your js code, it is called.
 6) Then plugin is being opened

Resulting html code should look like this:
```html
	<div id="windy-plugin-anyName" class="classesYouDefined" style="display:none;">
		<div class="closing-x"></div>
		Html content of your plugin
	</div>
```

### Opening
 1) The plugin element is enhanced with class `open` and its style is changed to `display: block;`
 2) CSS class `.onwindy-plugin-anyName` is attached to `<body>` element of page, so you can use CSS to modify other elements on page.
 3) If method `onopen` is exported in your js code, it is called. If the plugin was opened from `contextmenu` hook `{ lat, lon }` object is provided as parameters.

### Closing
 1) If method `ondestroy` exists in your js code it is called
 2) Class `open` is removed from the plugin element class to perform closing animation
 3) CSS class `.onwindy-plugin-anyName` is removed from `<body>` element of page
 4) The plugin element gets style `display: none;` after some time

After closing, your plugin is cleaned by default. But it is your responsibility to clean everything (hooks, elements created programatically, etc...) properly.

Plugins can be closed by clicking on their close button or programatically by broadcasting message `broadcast.emit('rqstClose', 'name-of-plugin')`
